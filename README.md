My first project learning/using ReactJS! Using hooks and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is hosted on [Netlify](https://elastic-lovelace-793083.netlify.app/).

This project is a simple website consuming the [API](https://github.com/bkullmanns/api-dogs) I created.
It is responsive with advanced CSS3 like Flexbox, CSS Grid, Selectors and CSS Modules.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
